    <p>This scrumptious looking cheesecake does not dissapoint. Its perfectly <em>creamy and smooth</em> texture creates a mouthwatering design. Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>900g Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>250g Sour Cream</li>
        <li>250g Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>250g Sugar</li>
        <li>10ml Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>6 Eggs</li>
        <li>5ml Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 Nabisco Original Graham Crackers</li>
        <li>100g Butter</li>
        <li>15g Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Jump on the Graham Crackers inorder to turn them into fine crumbs, then combine with the freshly melted butter and the sugar. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a springform, using hands or a flat-bottomed cup. Bake at 180 for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant, and let cool while preparing filling. Increase oven temp to 215.</li>
        <li>Mix the room-temp cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs <strong> AT A TIME (seriously!)</strong>, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, just until smooth - don't overmix as this will incorporate air and change the texture.</li>
        <li>Mix in lemon juice, vanilla extract, and salt until incorporated. Beat in the sour cream and heavy cream until just blended, scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is getting in there together.</li>
        <li>Once your crust and springform pan are cool enough to touch, nestle them into the slowcooker liner and place into the large pan you're using for the water bath. Gently pour your batter into the crust, and if needed, fold the top of the slow cooker liner down so it doesn't touch the batter. Bring some water to a boil and get ready to work quickly.</li>
        <li>To get your water bath in the oven with minimal risk of spilling hot water onto your cake or yourself: start with a preheated oven, a prepared water bath pan with the unbaked cake inside, and the hot water readily accessible. Quickly: open the oven and place the prepared water bath pan and unbaked cake on the center rack, sliding the rack in most of the way. Gently: pour the hot water into the pan, taking care not to get water inside the slow cooker liner. The water should come close to the top of the springform pan, but low enough to keep you from accidentally sloshing water onto the cake. Very very gently slide the rack the rest of the way into the oven and shut the door.</li>
        <li>Bake 10 minutes at 215, then <strong>decrease heat to 160</strong> and bake 50-60 minutes until set at the edges and still jiggly (but not liquid) in the center. Turn the oven off but leave the cheesecake inside with the door closed for 1 hour - this will help the cheesecake finish cooking and start to cool slowly to avoid cracking.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven, remove from the water bath, take off the slowcooker liner, and transfer to a rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>When the cheesecake is completely cooled, lightly cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and preferably overnight. This is the final set-up time the cake needs to be beautifully smooth and creamy throughout. Serve by itself, or with a drizzle of tart fruit or berry topping.</li>
